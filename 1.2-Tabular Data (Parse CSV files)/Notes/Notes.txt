Tutorial: The Coding Train (YouTube) - 1.2 Tabular Data - Working With Data & APIs in JavaScript
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfMkdvN-23o

Subjects: 
    Parsing CSV (Comma Seperated Values) files.
    Grab data with the Fetch() function. (https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)
    Load that data onto a webpage into a graph.

Main Steps:
    1. Load the CSV file.
    2. Parse the CSV file.
    3. Graph the data from the CSV file using the Chart.js JavaScript library.

Steps:

    0. Grab the CSV file and store it locally on your computer by going to 
    https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/. Scroll down to where it says
    'Tables of Global and Hemispheric Monthly Means and Zonal Annual Means'
    and download the last CSV file named 'Zonal annual means 1880 - Present'
    Store the CSV file in your project folder.

    1. Start with some boiler plate HTML with some links to where the data comes from to make sure you're referencing and crediting properly in your code:

    <!-- index.html -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>                     <!-- Specify the document type to be HTML. -->
        
        <head>                          <!-- Declare the head section.-->

            <meta charset="UTF-8"                                                 />      <!-- Declare the character set to be UTF-8. -->
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
            <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge"                  />
            
            <title> The Coding Train: 1.2 Tabular Data - Working With Data & APIs in JavaScript </title>
        
        </head>

        <body>

            <h1> The Coding Train: 1.2 Tabular Data - Working With Data & APIs in JavaScript </h1>

            <script>
                
                // Data from: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/
                // Mean from: https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/DecadalTemp

            </script>
            
        </body>

    </html>

    3. Look at the CSV file to see all the collumns of data seperated by comma's.
    To make it easier to debug create a smaller csv test file.
    Duplicate the CSV file and rename it to Test.csv and remove all of the data except for the top three rows.
    Once the parsing etcetera is working properly we load the full dataset.
